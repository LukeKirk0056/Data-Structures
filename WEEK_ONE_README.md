# Data-Structures2413
Notes and in class info for C S 2413

First, time should be invested in the beginning before you hit midway through semester and the coursework gets heavier

## 1-19-22
  
  * Canvas
    * Take advantage of canvas discussion boards
    * Do not ask questions that contain code
    
  * Code Post
    * If you have a coding question utilize Code Post and share there
      
  * Gradescope
    * Gradescope will automatically grade our projects, and published in canvas to be visible
    * Projects will explain what way for code to be written including names, input, output in order to be correct to be graded on gradescope
    * You can have it implemented completley but you have to use the inputs and outputs to get points
    * Multiple submissions allowed; last one is the one that will be graded.
    
  * IDE's provided by University of Oklahoma
    
    * Windows
      * Visual Studio
      * Eclipse
      * CLion
      
    * Mac 
      * Visial Studio Code (C++)
      * XCode
      * Sublime test + (g++)
      * Code Blocks

  
  For project think about this situation: 
  
  * everyone write their name on a board and pick a random place on the board to write your name
  * What would I have to do get all the names of everyone written on the board?
    * Could go through all names and worst case we'll arrive at the name were looking for via T or F
      * If names were alphabetical order we could binary search
      * Algorithms/Recursion
      
      Data structures goal is to access info/goal quickly and optimize time
      Data structures is useless without Algorithms (they go hand-in-hand)
      Do not expect help debugging code but if you have questions about the structure they can help
      Make sure you can describe what you have done when you ask for help then when they help go back to modify code.
      We use C++ because it is the most proper one for analyzing structures 
      Comment your code for both yourself and the TA's/Professor
