Notes and in class info for C S 2413

## 1-19-22
  * Canvas
    * Take advantage of canvas discussion boards
    * Do not ask questions that contain code
    
  * Code Post
    * If you have a coding question utilize Code Post and share there
      
  * Gradescope
    * Gradescope will automatically grade our projects, and published in canvas to be visible
    * Projects will explain what way for code to be written including names, input, output in order to be correct to be graded on gradescope
    * You can have it implemented completley but you have to use the inputs and outputs to get points
    * Multiple submissions allowed; last one is the one that will be graded.
    
  * IDE's provided by University of Oklahoma
    
    * Windows
      * Visual Studio
      * Eclipse
      * CLion
      
    * Mac 
      * Visial Studio Code (C++)
      * XCode
      * Sublime test + (g++)
      * Code Blocks

  
  For project think about this situation: 
  
  * everyone write their name on a board
  * pick a random place on the board to write your name
  * What would i have to do get all the names of everyone written on the board?
    * Could go through all names and worst case we'll arrive at the name were looking for via T or F
      * If names were alphabetical order we could binary search
      * ALgorithms/Recursion
      
      Data structures goal is to access info/goal quickly and optimize time
      Data structures is useless without Algorithms (they go hand-in-hand)
