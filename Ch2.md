# Chapter 2 Algorithms and Recursions
## Algorithms
  Input: Number and type of input values must be made clear
  Precise specification of each step: each step or instruction must be feasible and unambiguously defined
  Finiteness: for all input possibilites, the algorithm must terminate in finite time
  Result: The objective of the algorithm must be made clear. There may be an output that spells out the execution of the program.
  
### Resources and COmplexities
  Resources generallt attributed to a computer algorithm are space and running time.
  Space Complexity: amount of memory required
  Time complexity: Amount of time to complete execution
  Running time and space required are expressed as a function of the input size n
  Ex: algorithm which reads n numbers and prints them
    Time Complexity = n
    Space Complexity = 1
